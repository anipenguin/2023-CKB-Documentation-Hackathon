## 🔎 Project ideas



Let‘s go over the challenges which **include but not limited to:**

- **Onboarding Materials:** Create a guidebook for new CKB developers
- **Dev-Friendly Definitions:** Improve CKB glossary by revising or adding key Nervos-/ CKB-specific concepts, such as "[halving](https://docs.nervos.org/docs/reference/halving/#how-does-the-ckbyte-halving-work)”, “cycle”
- **Frictionless Tutorials:** Write learning-oriented tutorials for tools, such as [Lumos](https://github.com/ckb-js/lumos), [Capsule](https://github.com/nervosnetwork/capsule), and [Kuai](https://github.com/ckb-js/kuai)
- **Use Cases & Scenarios:** Create demos highlighting specific problems or scenarios, user cases, and expected behaviors where the tool is applied
- **Automated Tools:** Build a tool to improve CKB documentation discovery, e.g., a custom search engine to access existing CKB docs, a chat bot to answer CKB-related questions

Pick a focus that matches your skills and interest, go ahead and rock it!
